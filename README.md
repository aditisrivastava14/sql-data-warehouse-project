# 📊 Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome to my **Data Warehouse & Analytics Project repository!** 🚀
This project is part of my learning journey, where I designed and implemented a complete data warehousing and analytics solution. It highlights how I applied concepts of **ETL, data modeling, and analytics** using SQL Server and visualization tools.

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

I followed the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold)** approach to structure the data:

* **Bronze Layer**: Raw data from CSV files (ERP & CRM systems) stored in SQL Server.
* **Silver Layer**: Cleaned, transformed, and standardized data ready for analysis.
* **Gold Layer**: Business-ready data modeled into a **Star Schema** for reporting and analytics.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project covers the full lifecycle of data engineering & analytics:

* **Data Architecture**: Designed using Medallion layers.
* **ETL Pipelines**: Built with SQL scripts to extract, clean, transform, and load data.
* **Data Modeling**: Created **Fact & Dimension tables** for efficient analytics.
* **Analytics & Reporting**: Developed SQL-based queries and dashboards to generate insights.

## 🎯 Skills Showcased

Through this project, I got hands-on experience with:

* SQL Development
* Data Modeling (Star Schema)
* ETL Pipeline Development
* Data Warehouse Design
* Data Analytics & Reporting

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources Used

* **Datasets** → ERP & CRM sales data (CSV format)
* **SQL Server Express** → For hosting the Data Warehouse
* **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** → For managing databases and running SQL scripts
* **Draw\.io** → To design data models and architecture diagrams
* **GitHub** → For version control and project documentation

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### 1. Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

* Import datasets (ERP & CRM) into SQL Server.
* Clean and standardize raw data.
* Integrate both sources into a **consolidated data model**.
* Document the data model for clarity.

### 2. Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

Develop SQL-based insights on:

* Customer Behavior
* Product Performance
* Sales Trends
