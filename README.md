# 📊 Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome to my **Data Warehouse & Analytics Project repository!** 🚀
This project is part of my learning journey, where I designed and implemented a complete **data warehousing and analytics solution**. It highlights how I applied concepts of **ETL, data modeling, and analytics** using **MySQL Workbench** and visualization tools.

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

I followed the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold)** approach to structure the data:

* **Bronze Layer**: Raw data from CSV files (ERP & CRM systems) ingested into MySQL tables.
* **Silver Layer**: Cleaned, transformed, and standardized data stored in MySQL.
* **Gold Layer**: Business-ready data modeled into a **Star Schema** (Fact & Dimension tables) for reporting and analytics.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project covers the full lifecycle of **data engineering & analytics**:

* **Data Architecture** → Designed using Medallion layers.
* **ETL Pipelines** → Built with MySQL scripts to extract, clean, transform, and load data.
* **Data Modeling** → Created **Fact & Dimension tables** for analytical queries.
* **Analytics & Reporting** → Developed SQL-based queries and dashboards to generate insights.

## 🎯 Skills Showcased

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

* MySQL Development
* Data Modeling (Star Schema)
* ETL Pipeline Development
* Data Warehouse Design
* Data Analytics & Reporting

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources Used

* **Datasets** → ERP & CRM sales data (CSV format)
* **MySQL Community Server** → Database for building the Data Warehouse
* **MySQL Workbench** → GUI for managing databases and running SQL queries
* **Draw\.io** → For data architecture, data flow, and schema diagrams
* **GitHub** → For version control and project documentation

---

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### 1. Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

* Import datasets (ERP & CRM) into MySQL tables.
* Clean and standardize raw data.
* Integrate both sources into a **consolidated star schema model**.
* Document the data model for clarity.

### 2. Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

Develop SQL-based insights on:

* Customer Behavior
* Product Performance
* Sales Trends
